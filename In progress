I genuinely believe that music streaming is the future of the industry, and it has made music more accessible to people. However, there are many critics who believe that music streaming is hurting the industry, and that music streaming services do not pay artists enough money.

I want to better understand the impact of music streaming services on the music industry and artists based on revenues generated within the industry for artists. I also wish to identify which category of artists (based on popularity) benefit from or are hurt by these music streaming services. In completing this goal, I hope to clarify the misconceptions surrounding music streaming services, and if necessary, inform better royalty pool structures for current and future music streaming services in order to better serve artists. In achieving this, I plan to collect data on revenues generated in the US music industry by format (CD sales, concert ticket sales, vinyl sales, etc.) over 30+ years. Then, I will categorize artists based on their popularity by looking at social media likes/follows, and will collect data on their estimated revenues based on the existing royalty pool structures established by streaming services. Because my main goal is to demystify the impact music streaming services have on the music industry, my priority will lie in collecting data on revenues earned in the music industry.

Input: Literature review to see what people are actually saying about music streaming services and find out why people are saying streaming services are hurting the industry/artists 
Activities: RIAA collects data and tracks revenues generated in the industry. Each streaming service also collects data regarding streaming number
