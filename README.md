Social factors on writing efficiency:

Writing has been studied in a very niche way. It’s been treated as a subject that is highly personalized and individualized, like how each piece of student’s writing is carefully scrutinized by his or her teacher, either by hand or on computer. 

But I believe, like rest of the subject, specifically science; student’s writing skills (e.g. proficiency and fluency) can also be hugely influenced by social factors, such as which neighborhood they live in, what educational policies during this period of time, parenting style, or SES, etc. Therefore, in my study, I want to investigate how social factors impact student’s writing performance.

The educational goal is simple. I want to understand how social factors influence writing abilities individually or additively, and find the optimum environment that supports the development of student’s writing skills. In order to achieve the goal, I need to collect data about student’s social environment, like factors mentioned above, and one national-level writing assessment that reflects student’s writing skills (e.g. SAT writing). School and family factors are my priorities, however if these data is not sufficient, state level features may also be considered later in the study.
