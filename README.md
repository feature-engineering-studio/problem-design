* The problem you are addressing
MOOCs have drawn widespread attention for the past few years.  However, the high level of student dropouts has been central criticism.  Widely cited figure is that 90 % of students don’t finish their courses.  Researches have shown dropout does not only happen at the beginning of the course.  The number of students decreases progressively from a MOOC’s beginning to its end.  What’ s the reason behind it?  Should we come up solutions with the high dropout?

* The eductional goal that you plan to address
We have to aware there are different types of learners in MOOCs.  Besides to keep everyone in the course, it is more important to make sure the one fits in the certain course stays in.
