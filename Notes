Logic Model/Theory of Action (scientific method)

Input -  theory we're collecting, other thoughts about it, data points we had collected, opinions from someone , more qualatative?
Activity - Activities we care about (maybe artists going to Apple Music and being vocal?)
Output - What are we counting? What can we actually capture?  How granular? (how many time slices?) What meaning is ascribed to it? 
Outcomes -  What do we care about? (i want artists to utilize music streaming services to their benefit and see them as a beneficial tool for them as opposed to something that hurts them - prevent exclusives)
