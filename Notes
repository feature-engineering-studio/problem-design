Logic Model/Theory of Action (scientific method)

Input -  theory we're collecting, other thoughts about it, data points we had collected, opinions from someone , more qualatative?
Activity - Activities we care about (maybe artists going to Apple Music and being vocal?)
Output - What are we counting? What can we actually capture?  How granular? (how many time slices?) What meaning is ascribed to it? 
Outcomes -  What do we care about? (i want artists to utilize music streaming services to their benefit and see them as a beneficial tool for them as opposed to something that hurts them - prevent exclusives)

Process
1. Describe data
2. Choose methodology
3. Make notes on the purpose of the method
4. What data structure does method need? What structure do you have?
5. Make notes on the limitations of the method
6. Research the code
7. Toy data
8. What are the expected results?
9. Apply the code to your data

Feature Engineering
Using domain expertise to reason about what should be included in a model (i.e. classifier)
very similar to educational statistics
